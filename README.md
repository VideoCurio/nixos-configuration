# NixOS + COSMIC = Curi*OS*

This is my NixOS installer scripts and its configuration files. The desktop environment is [COSMIC](https://system76.com/cosmic/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Disclaimer:** This is a work in progress for a NixOS install and a Desktop Environment (COSMIC) still in Alpha stage.
> You should be familiar with [NixOS manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/) and [NixOS Wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Main_Page), for NixOS related questions go to [NixOS discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/).

## Quick start

> [!WARNING]
> The installation script will **FORMAT** your disk !!! Backup your data before.

1. Get the latest Curi*OS* 25.05 Minimal ISO image:
   ```bash
   wget --content-disposition https://github.com/VideoCurio/nixos-configuration/releases/download/25.05.1/curios-minimal_25.05.1_amd64-intel.iso
   ```
   Download and check iso signature:
   ```bash
   wget --content-disposition https://github.com/VideoCurio/nixos-configuration/releases/download/25.05.1/curios-minimal_25.05.1_amd64-intel.iso.sha256
   sha256sum --check curios-minimal_*.iso.sha256
   ```
   Must respond "Success".

2. Burn it on a USB stick with [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher), [caligula](https://github.com/ifd3f/caligula) or the command `dd`.
   ```bash
   # Good old dd:
   sudo dd if=curios-minimal_25.05.1_amd64-intel.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=10MB oflag=dsync status=progress
   # or shiny caligula:
   caligula burn -s $(cat ./curios-minimal_25.05.1_amd64-intel.iso.sha256)
   ```
   Replace `/dev/sdb` with the path of the USB card (see command `sudo fdisk -l`).
3. Boot your machine on the USB stick (F8 or F12 key on startup, see your motherboard manufacturer's instructions). An internet connection is *REQUIRED* to perform the installation !
4. You should see a TTY command line as `nixos` user, switch to root user:
   ```bash
   sudo -i
   ```
5. (**OPTIONAL**) Switch keymap on non-us keyboard: 
   ```bash
   loadkeys fr
   ```
6. Launch the installer script:
   ```bash
   curios-install
   ```
   ![Curios ISO install cmd](https://github.com/VideoCurio/nixos-configuration/blob/testing/img/Install_cmd.png?raw=true "CuriOS install command") 
7. Answer the various dialog questions:
   ![CuriOS installation step 1](https://github.com/VideoCurio/nixos-configuration/blob/testing/img/Install_dialog_1.png?raw=true "CuriOS installation Step 1")
   ![CuriOS installation choose disk](https://github.com/VideoCurio/nixos-configuration/blob/testing/img/Install_dialog_3.png?raw=true "CuriOS install choose disk")
   The full disk encryption option is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**.
   ![CuriOS full disk encryption](https://github.com/VideoCurio/nixos-configuration/blob/testing/img/Install_dialog_4.png?raw=true "CuriOS full disk encryption")
   ```bash
   # See --help option for more details:
   curios-install --help
   ```
8. If everything went according to plan, reboot.
   ![CuriOS install reboot](https://github.com/VideoCurio/nixos-configuration/blob/testing/img/Install_dialog_6.png?raw=true "CuriOs installation reboot")
9. **Enjoy!** User temporary password is **"changeme"**.
    You can now change it, within COSMIC desktop: click on top right power button, then Parameters > System & Accounts > Users > "Your Account Name" > Change password.
    Or use the command `passwd` in a terminal.

### Dot files

[curios-dotfiles](https://github.com/VideoCurio/nixos-dotfiles) come pre-installed with my COSMIC theme (WIP) and for a nice Alacritty and ZSH integration.

## Curi*OS* management

Activate or deactivate [modules](https://github.com/VideoCurio/nixos-configuration/tree/master/modules) to suit your needs and computer's hardware. [Modules](https://github.com/VideoCurio/nixos-configuration/tree/master/modules) configuration start with 'curios.'.

For example: you want to game and install Steam, Heroic launcher, Discord and more? Set: `curios.desktop.apps.gaming.enable` to `true;` into '/etc/nixos/settings.nix' file.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nixos/settings.nix
# Use Ctrl+s to save and Ctrl+x to exit nano
```
followed by:
```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```
You want a package not in one of the already pre-configured [modules](https://github.com/VideoCurio/nixos-configuration/tree/master/modules) ? Find more packages or options configuration at [NixOS packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=25.05&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages) and add it to `/etc/nixos/settings.nix`.

### System upgrade
When a new version of Curi*OS* is available, you will see a pop-up appear on your desktop:
![CuriOS updater screenshot](https://github.com/VideoCurio/nixos-configuration/blob/testing/img/Updater.png?raw=true "CuriOS updater")

To start the system upgrade, launch a terminal (Super + T) and type:
```bash
sudo curios-update --upgrade
```

### Flatpak / desktop apps installation
You can also install Linux applications as flatpak. [Flathub](https://flathub.org/) and COSMIC repositories come pre-installed by default. You can also use the "COSMIC store" app (it is sourced with flathub and COSMIC repos) as seen below:
![COSMIC Store screenshot](https://github.com/VideoCurio/nixos-configuration/blob/testing/img/Store.png?raw=true "COSMIC Store")

## NixOS management

NixOS is a Linux distribution based on the Nix package manager and build system. It supports reproducible and declarative system-wide configuration management as well as atomic upgrades and rollbacks, although it can additionally support imperative package and user management. In NixOS, all components of the distribution — including the kernel, installed packages and system configuration files — are built by Nix from pure functions called Nix expressions.
See [NixOS manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/) to learn more.

The default 'configuration.nix' is set to **AUTO UPDATE** every night at 03:40 or on your first boot of the day, see `systemctl list-timers`.

Generations older than 7 days are automatically garbage collected. You can also manually do the equivalent with:
```bash
sudo nix-collect-garbage --delete-older-than 7d && sudo nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade && sudo nixos-rebuild list-generations
```
Watch your root directories size with:
```bash
duf
# or
sudo du -sh /* 2>/dev/null | sort -rh
# From time to time, you can also free some space with:
sudo nix-store --gc
```
